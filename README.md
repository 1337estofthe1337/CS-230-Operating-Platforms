# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game “Draw It or Lose It”, which is currently available on Android. A single game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved – Different game types: Single Player Mode (1 team scenario, player vs player), Team Play Mode (more than 1 team involved, team vs team). Each team will have multiple players assigned to it – A team will consist of 2 or more players. Will there be a maximum player count for a team? Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name – A lookup for game/team names should be created to solve this problem. Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time – This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.
  
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I made sure the document was free of gramitical errors and the document reads well and is formatted well. The table was hard to format while also making sure the information was easy to read.

    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I liked seeing the outline of what to include in the design document and I have taken things away from the course in general that helps to develop the code such as the UML Diagram.

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise portions of the Game description by making it more thorough to describing the game. After re-reading the game description, I'm familiar of what needs to be done, but don't have a clear vision of the game itself.

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs will always be top priority and an overall satisfying user experience is what developers should strive for. Nobody wants to be on the feeding end of a shitty product.

    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software through a systematic approach of laying out my thoughts in a word/text document beforehand to see what I needed to do. Basically I made a TODO list in a separate document that I would slowly revise as more things needed to be done. I've been doing this approach for all my classes so far. Also google is your friend.
